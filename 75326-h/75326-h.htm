    This is not and is not intended to be a
    thoroughly complete explanation or discussion
    of the allotropic theory of iron
    and steel, but rather a brief outline of a
    few of the great principles of metallurgy
    written primarily for the layman. If
    without leading him astray from the real
    scientific understanding of the subject we
    have succeeded in briefly but satisfactorily
    answering the old familiar question,
    "Why do steels harden?", we will in a
    large measure, have accomplished our purpose.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "ein">
    Besides the personal observations which
    the writer has made from time to time in
    the metallurgical laboratory, he has availed
    himself freely of the works of many
    and eminent authors dealing with this
    subject and where disputable conditions
    have arisen in regard to certain theories,
    uses, etc., has attempted to adopt the
    most logical consensus of opinion.

        When as a student at a Technical College
        of one of our great Universities, I
        came to the study of Differential and
        Integral Calculus, I remember that I
        was seized with a kind of mental paralysis
        at the thought of the great unknown
        that lay before me. Fortunately, however,
        a little book was brought to my
        attention, under the encouraging title
        "Calculus Made Easy". As a matter
        of fact the little volume did not attempt
        to take its readers through all the intricacies
        of the entire subject, but it did
        succeed in giving a certain start on the
        long journey which has to be undergone
        by a student of the Calculus. Its
        opening sentence was encouraging,
        which I have always remembered, and
        which read something as follows:        
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        "What one fool can accomplish,
        another fool can do, therefore take
        courage". This same thought applies
        to the subject which is now before us.

        <p class = "ein">
        We live in a world in which certain
        conditions of the atmosphere and the
        so-called elements surrounding our
        daily existence, are entirely familiar to
        us. From force of habit we are likely
        to forget that had Nature, for instance,
        been planned under a different range
        of livable temperatures, all the familiar
        objects of our daily existence would
        have existed under entirely different
        form.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        For instance, if the normal temperature
        had been about 2700 degrees
        Fahrenheit instead of about 60 degrees
        Fahrenheit, and we had been constructed
        so that we could comfortably endure
        that degree of temperature, we
        could have gone sailing on a sea of
        molten iron, in boats built of plumbago
        crucibles, and oars made of silica brick.
        Under these delightful conditions we
        could place frozen lumps of our sea
        of iron in our ice boxes for refrigeration.
        Flat irons and stove lids would
        therefore have been the product of the
        ice man. The water with which we are
        now familiar, of course, could not exist
        in its liquid form, or even as steam, but
        instead as a highly gaseous state, which
        we would probably have been called
        upon to breathe. Certain other substances
        with which we are perfectly
        familiar in our daily life, such as the
        common stick sulphur, for instance,
        would exist in an entirely different
        <b>physical</b> state, although their <b>chemical</b>
        properties would be entirely unchanged,
        and we would be given to understand
        that an "allotropic" transformation had
        taken place.
        </p>
            
        <p class = "ein">
        If we can now imagine ourselves as
        existing under the relative conditions
        described above, which are undoubtedly
        the "natural" conditions of some other
        world, it will then be easy for us to
        understand quite clearly some of the
        other "allotropic" forms of iron and
        steel than those with which we are at
        present familiar.

        <h3>COMPARISON BETWEEN CONDITIONS WHICH<br>

        <p class = "ein">
        One of the first physical changes
        which we would discover would be that
        when we desired to "freeze" a "crucible"
        pailful of our iron water, we
        could do so much more easily if the
        same were in its absolutely pure state
        than we could if it were mixed with
        some other element, such as carbon.
        Of course, we have long known that
        this is the case with water and salt, and
        just as it becomes harder and harder to
        freeze water with greater and greater
        percentages of salt mixed with it, so
        the freezing of iron with greater and
        greater percentages of carbon mixed
        with it, would also occur at lower and
        lower temperatures.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        If we started to add salt to a pail
        of water we, of course, would have different
        degrees of brine. Just so with
        the addition of carbon to a crucible of
        pure iron, we would likewise have different
        degrees of the resulting mixture.
        In adding the salt to the pailful
        of water, we would arrive at a point
        where the water had absorbed all of
        the salt which it was capable of holding
        at room temperature. If we had added
        a little less salt we would have had free
        water in excess of salt, and if we had
        added a little more salt it would have
        been impossible for the water to have
        dissolved it, and we would, therefore,
        have had salt in excess of water.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        For convenience we will call the mixture
        above mentioned, at which the
        water had become thoroughly saturated
        with the salt, "cementite", because
        this is the name which our friends, the
        metallurgists, have given to a similar
        mixture of iron and carbon. They call
        the water, "ferrite"; the salt, "carbide"
        and the resulting mixture of brine,
        "cementite". This mixture of iron and
        carbon always exists in exactly the
        same ratio, namely, 93.4% iron and
        6.6% carbon, and is expressed chemically
        by the symbol Fe3C, which means,
        in other words, that three "atoms" of
        iron have united with one "<i>atom</i>" of
        carbon to form the "chemical compound",
        "iron carbide", which the metallurgists,
        as above mentioned, desire
        to term "Cementite".

        <p class = "ein">
        Now let us go back to the brine
        solution with which we are already
        familiar, and suppose that we added a
        little more salt than the water could
        absorb, and which therefore would exist
        in a "solid solution", and then bring this
        "mechanical mixture" to such a low
        temperature that it would actually
        "freeze". For convenience, and in
        order to agree with the metallurgists
        again, let us call the resulting structure
        "pearlite". That is the name which
        they have given to a corresponding
        "mechanical mixture" of cementite and
        ferrite.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        This new constituent "pearlite" contains
        approximately O.9% carbon and
        consists of inter-stratified layers or
        bands of ferrite and cementite.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        It is regarded as a separate and distinct
        constituent of steel, and takes its
        name from the fact that it has a mother of
        pearl-like appearance under the microscope.
        It always occurs at a definite range
        of temperature and always contains the
        above mentioned definite percentage
        of carbon.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        From the above it may be suspected
        that a steel containing O.9% carbon,
        consisting entirely of pearlite, forms
        rather a special and particular class of
        steels, which the metallurgists have decided
        to dignify with the title "Eutectoid
        Steels". Having done this much
        to properly impress the unsuspecting
        probers of their secrets, they decided
        to call steels containing less than this
        Eutectoid ratio of carbon (0.9% C)
        "Hypo-eutectoid Steels". These steels,
        of course, contain certain definite
        amounts of pearlite with other amounts
        of free or excess ferrite. Likewise, if
        the carbon content is greater than O.9%
        there will be an excess of cementite
        over the ferrite and we will then have
        a structure of pearlite plus free cementite.
        And these steels are spoken of
        as "hyper-eutectoid" steels.

        <h3>AN EXPERIMENT PERFORMED WITH A<br>
        PIECE OF PEARLITIC STEEL.</h3>
        </div>
            
        <p class = "ein">However, let us not trouble ourselves
        with too many definitions at one time,
        but instead amuse ourselves for a while
        by running through a little experiment
        with a piece of carbon tool steel similar
        to that which we have just been discussing.
        For our investigation we will
        also need a special kind of thermometer
        for measuring high temperatures.
        Such an instrument is known as a
        "pyrometer". Now we will drill a little
        hole in the test piece of carbon steel
        and after inserting the "couple" of the
        pyrometer into it, place the same in
        the electric furnace.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        As the current is turned on, the test
        piece begins to grow warm and then
        hotter and hotter, gradually up through
        a range of temperatures which are continually
        recorded by the needle of the
        pyrometer. 800, 900, 1000, 1200 degrees
        Fahrenheit are uniformly reached,
        and the temperature of our test
        piece continues to rise, as the absorption
        of heat progresses. Suddenly,
        however, the test piece assumes a
        bright glow and the needle of the pyrometer
        ceases to advance, and we note
        that it is pausing at about 1350 degrees
        Fahrenheit. Then after its pause, the
        advance is again resumed until the
        piece has become almost ready to melt.
        By plotting the uniform periods of time
        at which we read the different temperatures
        recorded by the needle of the
        pyrometer, against the temperatures
        as read, we would have a picture of our
        phenomenon something as follows:
        </p>
        
        <div style = "width: 80%; margin-left: 2.1em;">
        <img class = "center2 abst2 unten1-5" 
        src = "images/i_29.jpg"
        alt = "Graph showing the course of the temperature curve as a
        function of the heating time of the metal sample.">
        </div>   
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Now let us begin to let our test piece
        cool off gradually. The temperature
        of the furnace is lowered and the uniform
        range of cooling temperatures is
        recorded by the ever sensitive needle
        of the pyrometer. Suddenly as before,
        the test piece assumes the brilliant
        glow noted previously, and again the
        needle comes to rest, but this time we
        note that the recorded temperature is
        about 1250 degrees Fahrenheit instead
        of 1350 degrees Fahrenheit as before.
        Evidently there has been a certain
        tardiness or "lag" which has caused the
        phenomenon to take place a little too
        high going up and a little too low coming
        down, and in fact the metallurgists
        tell us that such is exactly the case, and
        that the real point in which we are interested
        lies just half way between the
        two points indicated, as we shall presently
        see. If we again represent the
        results of our latest experiment graphically,
        we would have a picture something
        as Fig. 2.
        </p>
        
        <div style = "width: 80%; margin-left: 2.2em">

        </div>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Now placing the second curve so obtained
        on the first, we are able to
        study the following interesting relationship.
        Fig. 3.
        </p>
        
        <div style = "width: 80%; margin-left: 2.1em;">

         alt = "Graph combining the heating- and cooling-curves from

        </div>

        <p class = "ein">It is natural to suspect that both of
        the parallel sections of our curves have
        something to do with the same thing,
        and for convenience since we noticed
        that mysterious glow of the test piece
        just as the needle came to rest, we
        might call the particular point which
        lies just half way between the temperatures
        under discussion, the point of
        glow, or as the metallurgists call it,
        the "point of recalescence" and the
        range between these two temperatures
        the "critical range".
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        I suppose it would be difficult to
        explain this phenomenon of the test
        piece unless we imagine that as the
        critical range is reached some internal
        reaction of the steel causes it to spontaneously
        take on heat at the same
        temperature in the first place and give
        off the stored heat at the same temperature
        as the piece was being cooled down,
        and this heat caused it to glow as was
        noticed. Now if we were to experiment
        further with our piece while at
        the critical range, we would find certain
        other remarkable changes, one of
        the most noticeable of which is the
        loss of magnetism at and above the
        critical range.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Irons and steels are usually the most
        magnetic materials, but the attraction
        of the magnet is completely lost at or
        above the critical range.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        We can easily satisfy ourselves in
        this respect by noting the attraction
        of a simple horse shoe magnet when
        our piece of test steel is brought into
        its magnetic field. As the pyrometer
        needle passes on up through the range
        of temperatures noted above, the magnetic
        attraction is perfectly evident
        when suddenly the recalescence point
        is reached, the spell is broken and the
        magnet and the test piece fall apart.
        But let us just consider this phenomenon
        a moment. We are told by the
        physicists that magnetism is induced
        in a piece of iron or steel by a "rearrangement
        of the internal molecular
        structure, in which the positive ions
        face one direction and the negative ions
        in the opposite direction". Therefore,
        if magnetism suddenly ceases to exist
        it would seem as if something had happened
        to the "internal molecular structure"
        of the test piece. Thus when the
        recalescence point is reached we may
        conclude that something more than a
        mere absorption of heat units has taken
        place. In fact we may really believe
        that an actual internal molecular revolution
        has occurred and that some
        of the natural laws which formerly had
        governed all of these little molecules
        which go to make up the whole piece
        of steel, have been overthrown and that
        the molecules are more or less free to
        set up a new form of government for
        themselves, and that, therefore, when
        a piece of steel is brought to the recalescence
        point it is really in a very
        sensitive condition. In fact, if we
        should care to investigate further we
        should find that certain other great
        changes take place at this critical point,
        such, for instance, as partial failure of
        the test piece to conduct an electric
        current, which formerly, of course, it
        did with great ease. Also when the
        critical range is reached, a peculiar contraction
        of size interrupts the gradual
        expansion which had been developing
        as the test piece absorbed heat units,
        and therefore these several observations
        give us reason to believe that our
        conclusions as noted above must be
        more or less correct.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Now if all steels acted exactly like
        the little test piece which we have been
        observing above as they were placed
        in the hardening furnace, it would not
        take us very much longer to finish our
        preliminary investigations. You remember
        the piece of steel which we
        have been investigating was a piece
        of simple carbon tool steel, containing
        about 0.90% carbon. But all steels do
        not contain just this same percentage of
        carbon, and may also contain various
        elements other than carbon, all of which
        produce many and varied results during
        the process of heating, treating and
        hardening.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        In order to better visualize the investigation
        which we are making, let
        us picture graphically each step which
        we take. If therefore, we let the vertical
        lines represent the different carbon
        contents which steel might have,
        and the horizontal lines the different
        degrees of temperatures through which
        we might desire to heat the steel under
        discussion and then plotted the phenomenon
        described above we would have
        a picture something as follows:
        </p>

        <div style = "width: 80%">
        <img class = "center2 abst2 unten1-8" src = "images/i_36.png"
         alt = "Graph showing the point of recalescence">    
        </div>    

        <p class = "ein">
        Now all that picture means is that
        as we heated up a piece of simple carbon
        tool steel containing O.9% C, we discovered
        a certain very noticeable reaction
        which occurred just about half
        way between 1250 degrees and 1350
        degrees Fahrenheit, which we decided
        to call the point of recalescence, and
        then on further heating of the piece
        no other such phenomenon was noticed.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Now let us go through the same
        experiment with a piece of steel containing
        .45% C. Yes, just as before,
        as the temperature 1250 degrees Fahrenheit
        is reached we note all the
        strange symptoms which are characteristic
        of the point of recalescence and
        then, just as we are about to decide that
        it is hardly necessary to go further we
        notice that the pyrometer needle has
        again come to rest, but that this time
        it is registering 1390 degrees Fahrenheit.
        Therefore, it would seem as if
        this piece had two critical ranges instead
        of one and we are now quite
        ready to again proceed with our heating
        to see if anything else occurs.
        However, as nothing does happen we
        turn to our picture and plot the two
        points just observed, together with the
        one point found on our first investigation,
        and the drawing then looks something
        as follows:
        </p>

        <div style = "width: 80%">
        <img class = "center2 abst2 unten1-8"
        src = "images/i_38.png"
        alt = "Graph additional shows the recalescence of a 
               second sample containing a different rate of carbon">    
        </div>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Now let us take a piece of carbon
        steel as before, but this time containing
        .15% carbon, and again proceed
        with our observations. Again the
        needle of the pyrometer records the
        point of recalescence and also the point
        designating the second range of critical
        temperature, but this time strange to
        say, as the test piece continues to absorb
        heat, a third critical range is registered,
        all of which when added to our
        former picture gives a result something
        as follows:
        </p>
    
        <div style = "width: 80%">
        <img class = "center2 abst2 unten1-8"

        alt = "Graph showing different behavior of
               samples containing different rates of carbon">    
        </div>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        By repeating the operations as outlined
        above, with pieces of steel containing
        various percentages of carbon
        from zero to 1.25% and by plotting the
        different critical temperatures so obtained,
        we finally obtain a chart which
        graphically expresses the critical ranges
        of iron and steels due to the variation
        of the carbon content. With very low
        carbon steel it is interesting to note
        that the first critical point would not
        occur until 1395 degrees Fahrenheit
        was reached.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Metallurgists have long designated
        the lines so obtained by letters, "r",
        standing for, "refroidissement", which
        is the French word meaning "cooling",
        the suffixes 1-2-3 simply standing for
        the lines in the order drawn.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        From the completed chart it is
        further evident that our first piece containing
        0.9% carbon in one way is the
        most interesting of all since it is the
        only case where only one point of critical
        temperature occurs.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        It will be noticed from the chart that
        steels containing less than .10% carbon
        have no point Ar1 and it is therefore
        undoubtedly due to the carbon content
        that this, the point of recalescence, occurs.
        From tests which we made with
        the magnet we would also find that
        the temperatures at which loss of magnetism
        occurs are those designated by
        the line Ar2, whereas the loss of
        ability to conduct an electric current
        occurs at the point designated Ar3.
        In steels containing .45% carbon to
        .75% carbon loss of magnetism and loss
        of ability to conduct an electric current
        occur at the same points designated on
        our chart by the line Ar3-2; whereas
        in the steel containing .90% carbonâ€”all
        these changes take place at the same
        time.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Now, as we concluded before, it is
        evident that some internal change must
        have taken place in the steel itself, and
        as we know that the chemical content
        does not vary, it is further evident that
        the change must be of a physical nature,
        or as in the language of the
        Metallurgist, an "allotropic change".
        Therefore, another conclusion which
        we can draw at this point is that a very
        much more thorough investigation is
        required for the proper handling of
        steel at high temperatures than a mere
        knowledge of the chemical analysis of
        the same.
        </p>
    
        <p class = "ein">
        There is one very fortunate circumstance
        connected with the passing from
        one of these allotropic changes to
        another, and that is that the effecting
        of one of these changes takes <b>time</b>. It
        does not take a very long time, however,
        for in some instances the change
        is affected in a very small fraction of
        a second, while rarely more than one
        or two seconds are required. The
        higher the temperature the quicker the
        change.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Would it not be interesting if we
        had been so constructed as outlined in
        the beginning of this little volume;
        that we could have withstood the high
        temperatures in which some of these
        very interesting changes occur, because
        we could then handle the steel, examine
        it and experiment with it at our leisure.
        However, such not being the case, we
        will have to derive some other means
        for "catching" the steel while it is in
        one of these interesting conditions, and
        then bringing it in its entrapped condition
        down to room temperature. How
        shall we do it? Well, we remember
        that we said it took <b>time</b> to effect the
        changes under discussion and furthermore
        we remember that the changes
        can only take place when the steel is
        within the proper critical range.
        Therefore, if we could do something
        to lower the temperature of a piece of
        steel while in one of the critical ranges
        before the steel had time to effect the
        usual allotropic change of form, we
        might be able to catch a piece of steel
        while in one of these unusual conditions,
        before it had really had time to
        get back to normal.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Therefore, let us place a piece of .9%
        carbon tool steel in the heating furnace
        and bring it up to and beyond the point
        of recalescence. Now, grasping the
        piece firmly in a pair of tongs with all
        possible speed we plunge it into a nearby
        pail of ice water, keeping the steel
        constantly in motion. Almost instantly
        the steel becomes black and within a
        few seconds is actually brought down
        to room temperature.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Now let us take the steel out and
        examine it. The act of tapping it on
        the anvil in order to knock off the surplus
        water gives us a hint that our test
        piece has undergone some sort of a
        change. For now it rings with a bell-like
        clearness and gives the hammer
        with which we strike it a quick snapping
        rebound which in itself indicates
        great hardness. Next, we test the
        piece with a hardened steel file with
        which we could easily have made a
        deep ridge before we attempted the
        heating operation and to our surprise
        the file has as little effect as if it had
        been made of wood. And to our surprise
        on closer examination, we actually
        find that our test piece has scratched
        the fileâ€”surely it must be very hard.
        We are convinced that some marked
        change must have taken place. What
        can it be? Why it must be that due
        to the rapid cooling in the pail of ice
        water we brought the temperature
        of the test piece down below the critical
        range <b>before</b> the abnormal condition
        at which it existed while at and above
        the critical range had found <b>time</b> to
        change back to its former condition.
        And we remember that if one of these
        allotropic changes is going to take place
        at all, nature says it <b>must</b> do so while
        the steel is within the critical range
        and therefore having forced the steel
        through that critical range which
        separates one allotropic condition from
        another, before it had found <b>time</b> to
        effect its desired change, we managed
        to entrap the abnormal condition so
        that we could see it and feel it and
        get familiar with it at room temperature.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        If we so desire we can now make
        other hardness tests on our piece of
        steel at our leisure. For these scientists
        have invented several machines.
        One of the most common is called the
        scleroscope in which a hardened steel
        ball is allowed to drop from a given
        height on to the piece of steel to be
        tested. Then the rebound of the ball
        is carefully noted. The higher the rebound,
        the harder the piece. That is
        natural isnâ€™t it? We know that if the
        ball were allowed to drop on butter,
        it wouldnâ€™t rebound at all, because the
        butter is so soft. A piece of wood
        would possibly record a very tiny rebound,
        while a piece of hardened tool
        steel would effect a very material action
        of the scleroscope ball, thus indicating
        extreme hardness.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Now let us take our test piece to
        the grind stone and grind it down to
        the shape of a cutting tool. It is necessary
        to resort to the grind stone, in
        order to get the desired shape, because
        of course, our test piece is far too hard
        to cut with any other metal. After
        having produced a tool of the desired
        shape and size, let us fasten the same
        securely into the carriage of a lathe,
        and then upon applying the cutting
        edge to a revolving piece of cast iron,
        or soft steel, or even to a piece of the
        very same grade of steel out of which
        the tool was made, only while it is
        still in the softened or annealed condition,
        we find that it is capable of easily
        and quickly cutting out a good sized
        ribbon of chips from the metal which
        is to be machined.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        However, we are soon confronted
        with a new difficulty, for as the cut
        progresses, our tool runs into a rough
        spot which causes it to tremble and
        chatter and then suddenly our tool
        cracks in two in the middle and is at
        once completely ruined.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        It is evident that as we are able to
        increase the desirable element of hardness
        in a piece of tool steel, we also
        automatically increase the undesirable
        element of brittleness, and therefore
        some new method must be devised
        which will allow a sufficient degree of
        hardness to allow the tool to cut other
        metals and at the same time not cause
        so much brittleness that it will crack
        in two at the first rough spot which it
        encounters.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        One method of assisting the toughening
        of a piece of hardened tool steel
        is accomplished by the process of
        "drawing". This simply means heating
        the piece of hardened tool steel
        up to some fairly warm temperature,
        which of course must be kept well below
        the critical range (at which the
        steel would jump at the chance to
        quickly change back into one of its
        softer allotropic forms) and then keeping
        the steel at this drawing temperature
        for a while until the unusual
        strains and stress caused by the rapid
        cooling have had an opportunity to
        have become somewhat relieved.
        Therefore, the process of "drawing" is
        quite as important as is the first act
        of hardening itself, and great care must
        be exercised in undertaking the same.

        <h3>HIGH SPEED STEELS.</h3>
        </div>   
    
        <p class = "ein">
        After the processes of hardening and
        drawing our sample of simple carbon
        tool steel have become thoroughly
        mastered, it might seem that all which
        was desired had been accomplished and
        that we could go on indefinitely making
        and using our simple carbon steel tools.
        However, when the extraordinary demands
        of modern industry required
        faster and faster cutting speeds, and
        deeper and deeper cuts, we commenced
        to realize that our familiar carbon tool
        steels would not fill the bill. This was
        due to the fact that as the tools became
        pressed with the faster speeds
        and deeper cuts, they could not do their
        work without becoming over-heated by
        the friction caused by the work of upsetting
        the chip and therefore the critical
        temperature was rapidly approached.
        Of course we know that if this
        temperature should be reached the
        steel would quickly lose its hardness
        and its cutting edge would therefore
        be completely ruined.
        </p>

        <p class = "ein">
        Therefore, it was necessary to develop
        a new kind of steel to meet a
        new and severe condition and accordingly
        the mother of experiment and
        invention gave birth to the now famous
        "High Speed" Steel.
        </p>

        <p class = "ein">
        The general principles applying to
        the hardening and drawing of High
        Speed Steel are in many ways the same
        as described above for the simple carbon
        steel, except that as we begin to
        add various elements other than carbon
        to the melt, the resulting alloy becomes
        more and more complex in its form and
        reactions and therefore its heat treatment
        causes greater and greater study
        and skill in its successful undertaking.
        </p>

        <p class = "ein">
        It is generally known among tool
        hardeners that it is necessary to heat
        the tool to a higher degree of temperature
        in order to secure proper hardness
        when using High Speed Steel than it
        is when a simple Carbon Tool Steel is
        employed. We are told that the introduction
        of certain elements into the
        melt of a simple Carbon Tool Steel
        has the tendency to change the critical
        range. Of course, the formulas used
        in the manufacture of any high grade
        High Speed Steel contain very appreciable
        amounts of various elements
        other than Carbon which materially
        effect the property which the steel will
        have when hard. The effect which
        these elements appear to produce in the
        period of critical range can be seen
        from figure 7.

        <p class = "ein">
        In this case an experiment was made
        with a piece of High Tungsten High
        Speed Steel similar to the experiment
        which was described in detail above with
        the test piece of simple Carbon Tool Steel.
        The readings of the pyrometer were carefully
        recorded and when plotted on the
        graph sheet produced the picture under
        discussion.
        </p>

        <p class = "ein">
        Here it will be noticed that the vivid
        reaction, which we might have expected
        would occur as the temperature indicating
        the first critical range was reached,
        was materially reduced. This
        might lead us to suspect that the desired
        allotropic change had not completely
        taken place at this point. In
        fact we noticed that the pyrometer
        needle did not record a vivid critical
        point until a very much higher temperature
        was reached. All of these
        observations serve as a possible explanation
        or indication of why it is necessary
        to employ very much higher
        temperatures in the hardening of High
        Speed Steel than it is in the hardening
        of a piece of simple Carbon Tool Steel.

        <p class = "ein">
        In a later chapter of this little volume
        we define Carbon Steels as those which
        do <b>not</b> contain enough of any element
        other than carbon to materially affect
        the physical properties which the steel
        will have when hard. High Speed
        Steels which are one of a very important
        group of special alloy steels, are
        those steels to which some element
        <b>other</b> than carbon has been added in
        sufficient amount to materially effect
        the physical properties which the steel

        features looked for in High
        Speed Steels is Tungsten. We will discuss
        the various effects which the different
        elements give to the different
        alloy steels in a later chapter, but for
        the present we will confine ourselves
        to a brief discussion of the heat treatment
        of the now famous modern High

        As previously suggested the pressing
        demand of modern industry for quicker
        work, greater efficiency and enormously
        increased out-put of product, gave
        rise to the necessity of producing far
        more remarkable tools than was possible
        with the old fashioned carbon tool
        steel. Therefore it became necessary
        to produce a steel which could be rendered
        sufficiently hard to cut deep furrows
        in the various metals which have
        to be machined and, which could be
        made sufficiently tough to stand the
        enormous cutting strains and chatter
        and vibration of the machine, and at
        the same time maintain all these characteristics
        when the work done by upsetting
        the chip of the machined member
        actually rendered the cutting edge
        of the tool red hot.
        </p>

        <p class = "ein">
        After the seemingly impossible task
        of producing a steel to meet these terrific
        conditions had been successfully accomplished,
        the next question which
        arose was to produce a machine which
        was sufficiently powerful to stand the
        work done by the tool, and so fast has
        been the progress made by the tool
        steel producer, that many of our modern
        manufacturing industries of today
        are constantly having to introduce new
        and heavier machinery into their various
        machine shop and tool rooms in
        order to keep pace with the possibilities
        of the tool made from the modern
        High Speed Steel.
        </p>

        <p class = "ein">
        Now, if we were to run an experiment
        with a test piece made from High
        Speed Steel similar to the one which
        we ran on the simple Carbon Tool
        Steel, we would find that many of the
        same phenomena previously noticed
        would again be recorded.
        </p>

        <p class = "ein">
        Probably the most important difference
        would be the fact that instead of
        having to quench the same in water
        it would be desirable to use a bath of
        oil. In fact, water would cause the
        High Speed Steel to cool off far too
        quickly so that it would be likely to
        crack and be rendered useless.
        </p>

        <p class = "ein">
        A peculiar action of the various elements
        in High Speed Steel is very
        likely to materially retard the change
        of one allotropic form into another. In
        fact, the change is so slow that after
        a piece of High Speed Steel has been
        heated above the critical temperature,
        it will actually retain its hardened or
        austenitic condition even if allowed to
        cool in the air, and it would only be
        possible to get it back into its softened
        condition by the lengthy process of
        annealing.
        </p>

        <p class = "ein">
        Annealing is the process of undoing
        exactly what the act of hardening accomplished.
        Long tubes are filled with
        the tool steel bars and sealed from the
        air and then placed into the annealing
        furnaces, wherein the annealing temperature
        is maintained for a sufficient
        number of hours, until the steel has
        had an opportunity to become
        thoroughly softened.

        As before stated "drawing" or "tempering"
        means the careful re-heating
        of the steel to 400 degrees Fahr. to
        600 degrees Fahr., thus allowing a
        slight "slipping" of enough of the higher
        allotropic solution to a lower form,
        which it is always eager to accomplish
        at temperatures near the point of recalescence.
        This, of course, relieves

        Annealing is the complete release of

        and the "trapped" carbon which
        allows of their return to the normal
        condition of pearlite and alpha iron.
        Therefore, it is necessary to heat the
        steel above the point of recalescence
        and cool more or less slowly. Different

        <p class = "ein">
        We know that all metals of engineering
        nature are crystalline in character,
        that is, the crystals form when the metal
        solidifies. If these crystals were
        free it would be easy to determine definitely
        just what properties the metal
        would have. However, the crystals are
        not free, but exist in the steel in combination
        with many other types of
        crystals. This results in many complicated
        and complex possibilities in the
        finished product, and will bring us presently
        to the subject of "Alloy Steels".

                CARBON STEELS.</h3>
        </div>

        <p class = "ein">
        Carbon Steels are those which do
        <b>not</b> contain enough of any element
        <b>other</b> than carbon to materially affect
        the physical properties which the steel
        will have when hard. Carbon is one
        element used above all others by manufacturers
        in getting required physical
        properties. An increase of one hundredth
        of one per cent (.01%) gives a
        tensile strength of about one thousand
        pounds per square inch, but even this
        amount of carbon also regularly decreases
        the ductility of the finished
        product. When steel is heated red hot
        and plunged into water, the carbon in
        the metal unites with the iron in some
        peculiar way so that it produces a compound
        of extreme hardness. If the
        steel contains nine-tenths of one per
        cent (.90%) of carbon, a sharp point
        so quenched will almost scratch glass.
        With one per cent (1.00%) of carbon
        it reaches nearly its limit of hardness.
        Now carbon steels with this percentage
        carbon can be used for some of
        the harder tools, which do not require
        much ductility or toughness, but with
        higher carbon contents than this percentage,
        the brittleness increases so
        fast that the usefulness of the metal
        is decidedly limited.

        <p class = "ein">
        Therefore, when the steel must
        meet requirements other than just that
        of hardness, such as, strength, ductility,
        toughness, resistance to repeated
        shock, "red hardness", etc., then it is
        necessary to resort to other means and
        combinations for obtaining the required
        needs. It is to be remembered that
        such methods and combinations will
        materially increase the cost of the final
        product.

        </div>

        <p class = "ein">
        What is an alloy steel? The
        general definition of an alloy steel is,
        "a solidified solution of two or more
        metallic substances". The International
        Committee upon the nomenclature
        of iron and steel defines alloy
        steels as "those steels which owe their
        properties chiefly to the presence of an
        element (or elements) <b>other</b> than carbon".
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        This latter definition more nearly
        applies to our case, but it must be born
        in mind that the distinction between an
        element added merely to produce a
        slight benefit to ordinary carbon steel,
        and the very same element added to
        produce an alloy steel itself, is sometimes
        a very delicate one. For example:
        Manganese is added in
        amounts usually less than 1.50% to all
        Bessemer and Open-Hearth Steels, for
        the purpose of getting rid of oxygen,
        and neutralizing the effect of the sulphur.
        But this does not produce an
        Alloy Steel. When we make "manganese
        steel" containing 10 to 20%
        manganese, the material then has properties
        quite different from the same
        steel without the manganese, and we
        then have a Manganese Alloy Steel.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Thus, for our purpose, we may
        consider an alloy steel as being one to
        which some element <b>other</b> than carbon
        has been added in sufficient amount to
        materially affect the physical properties
        which the steel will have when
        hard.

                HIGH SPEED STEELS.</h3>
        </div>

        <p class = "ein">
        High Speed Steels are perhaps the
        most important of alloy steels, and derive
        their name from the fact that they
        can be used as cutting tools when the
        cut on the machined member is being
        made at a high speed. This, of course,
        subjects the tool to severe operating
        conditions, which simple carbon steels
        could not stand. These steels have
        other notable characteristics, among
        which is that of "self-hardening" or
        "air-hardening", as it is sometimes
        called. This means, when the steel
        cools naturally in the air, from a red
        heat or above, it is not soft like ordinary
        steel, but is hard and capable of
        cutting other metals.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Another striking characteristic of
        high speed steels is their ability to
        maintain a sharp cutting edge while
        heated to a temperature far above that
        which would at once destroy the cutting
        ability of a simple tool steel. Because
        of this property, a tool made of
        high speed steel can be made to cut
        continuously at speeds three to five
        times as great as that practicable with
        other tools. The result of the friction
        of the chip on the tool may cause the
        tool to become red hot at the point on
        top where the chip rubs hardest, and
        the chip may, itself, by its friction on
        the tool, and the internal work done on
        it, by upsetting it, be heated to a blue
        heat, or even hotter.

        The base of all steels is Iron. It
        goes without saying that this element
        should be obtained in the best and
        purest state possible. Probably the
        best "base" iron comes largely from
        Sweden, which country seems to have

        <p class = "ein">
        Carbon has already been discussed
        under Carbon Steels, although, of
        course, its importance in Alloy Steels
        must not be under-estimated. The
        proportion of carbon aimed at in high
        speed tool steels is about 0.65%, which
        in simple steel would not be enough to
        give the maximum hardness, even if
        the steel were heated above the critical
        point and quenched in water, and still
        less so when the steel is cooled as slowly
        as these steels are in their treatment.
        This shows that the carbon element
        acts in a different way from what it
        does in simple carbon steels as previously
        discussed.

        <p class = "ein">
        Manganese Steel is a typical self-hardening
        steel and so, obviously, is
        any steel which is in the austenitic condition
        at atmospheric temperatures,
        that is to say, whose critical temperature
        is below atmospheric temperature.
        Thus, self-hardening steels are non-magnetic.
        Because of its low-yield
        point, manganese steel does not give
        satisfaction in many lines, for which
        otherwise it might be eminently fitted.
        </p>

        <p class = "ein">
        Manganese used in <b>small</b> quantities
        (.30% to 1.50%) will produce certain
        desired effects. Under these conditions
        it acts as a purifier. And when
        added in the form of Ferro Manganese
        to a heat of steel it unites with the
        oxygen and transforms it to slag as
        oxide of manganese. There is also
        good reason for believing that manganese
        prevents the coarse crystallization,
        which impurities such as Phosphorus
        and Sulphur would otherwise
        produce. Five per cent to 14% manganese
        renders the steel non-magnetic as well
        as a poor conductor of electricity.

        The dividing line between silicon-treated

        used for several important purposes.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Such steel has been used in springs
        of the leaf type for automobiles and
        other vehicles, the silicon being considered
        to add slightly to the toughness
        of the springs. However, the most
        important use of steels of this type is
        probably in the manufacture of electrical
        machinery. It is possible to produce
        a silicon-alloy steel which has not
        only a greater magnetic permeability
        than the purest iron, but also, a high
        electrical resistance. Its hysteresis is,
        of course, low, this property always accompanying
        a high permeability. It
        therefore is a very valuable material
        for use in electro-magnets, and in electric
        generating machinery, is the most
        efficient material known.

        Chromium is an indispensable constituent

        steel, even when used alone. The chief
        effect which chromium produces in high
        speed steels is undoubtedly that of
        "hardening". However, chromium,
        like carbon, will produce brittleness, if
        added in too large quantities, although
        if kept down to between 2 to 5% it
        seems to allow the lowering of the carbon
        element, while at the same time
        maintaining the desired hardening effect,
        without causing undue brittleness.
        The great hardness in the face of an
        armor plate, and the great toughness
        in the back of the plate, also the superb
        properties in the projectile which attempts

        not the best one for high speed steels.
        Tungsten was discovered as an element
        which gave the steel properties
        of hardness and toughness at a red
        heat. After the peculiar heat treatment
        had been learned, and the presence
        of manganese or chromium in
        addition to the tungsten was shown to
        be unnecessary in appreciable amounts,
        it was found that more durable qualities
        could be obtained by increasing
        the percentage of tungsten, while at
        the same time the carbon element was
        greatly reduced.

        The reason for this is that it was found

        0.15% in order to obtain very noticeable
        results. In addition to acting as
        a very great strengthener of steel, especially
        against dynamic strains, vanadium
        also serves as a scavenger in getting
        rid of oxygen and possibly nitrogen.
        It is also said to decrease segregation,
        which we may readily believe,
        as most of the elements which quiet the
        steel have this effect.

        course, especially useful for all purposes
        where strength and lightness are
        desired, such as springs, axles, frames

                HEAT TREATMENT.</h3>

        <p class = "ein">
        The heat treatment of tool steels is of
        the utmost importance. Tool makers
        of the old school proved their ability
        to accomplish certain desired results in
        the art of heat treatment without really
        fully understanding exactly how or
        why they were able to do so. Today,
        however, progressive manufacturers
        are using the results of research and
        such thorough scientific investigation
        that the process has become far more
        complicated and complex, and the results
        obtained are correspondingly
        more remarkable.

        Chemically perfect steel may be
        easily and completely ruined during
        the process of melting, cogging, rolling,
        hammering, annealing, heat treating
        and tempering. It is the business
        of the steel manufacturer to carefully
        guard his product up through the process
        of annealing, but it usually falls to
        the tool maker to undertake the delicate
        operations of heat treatment and
        tempering.

                HARDENING.</h3>
        </div>

        <p class = "ein">
        The application of heat alone to
        steel can very materially affect the
        condition of the structure of the metal,
        either with or without simultaneous
        mechanical treatment. Depending upon
        the degree of heat, the rate of heating
        and cooling and the duration of
        such treatment, this application may be
        decidedly beneficial or harmful as the
        case may be.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        We now know that when steel is
        heated above the critical point, and is
        then allowed to rapidly cool, a very
        marked hardness in the metal is produced.
        The degree of hardness so attained
        will, in general, vary directly
        with (1) the percentage of carbon, (2)
        the rate of cooling, (3) and the temperature
        above the critical point from
        which the cooling takes place. When
        the steel comes from the rolling mill
        and from the finishing hammers it is
        in this hardened condition. Therefore,
        in order to render it soft and ductile
        enough to cut and work up into certain
        desired shapes, sizes and tools, it is
        necessary to subject the steel to the
        process of annealing. This operation
        is usually undertaken by the steel producer,
        under which circumstances he
        is able to control his product through
        this delicate procedure, and deliver the
        same to his customers in the best possible
        condition for their use.

                ANNEALING.</h3>
        </div>

        <p class = "ein">
        Annealing has for its object: (1)
        Completely undoing the effect of hardening,
        leaving the steel soft and ductile
        (2) refining the grain, in which case
        the crystals are allowed to re-arrange
        and re-adjust themselves, usually growing
        to a rather large size (3) and removing
        strains and stresses caused by
        too rapid cooling. Such cooling
        strains are particularly likely to exist
        where the rate of cooling is different in
        different parts of the bar, but the process
        of annealing ought to remedy any
        such condition, leaving the steel soft,
        ductile and of refined and uniform
        crystalline structure throughout.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        The process of annealing is easier
        to explain than it is to actually put
        into practice. The steel is first packed
        in lime, charcoal, fine dry ashes or
        sand, and then sealed in long air-tight
        tubes or boxes.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        The whole receptacle is next slowly
        brought up to a dull red heat, of
        about 1500 degrees Fahrenheit.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        It is very important to heat the
        material uniformly all the way through,
        and then hold it in this condition from
        three to eight hours. Thus, allowing
        the slipping of one allotropic condition
        into another.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        The receptacle must be cooled
        equally slowly, either allowing the
        packed steel to cool slowly down with
        the furnace, or by placing the same in
        a soaking or cooling pit, which also
        accomplishes the desired result.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        After the receptacle has become
        entirely cooled it is opened and the

        before shipping to the tool maker.

                TEMPERING.</h3>
        </div>

        <p class = "ein">
        The process of tempering usually
        has to be undertaken by the tool maker
        or user after the annealed steel, which
        he received from the steel mill, has
        been cut up and shaped into the desired
        form and size.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        The main object of tempering
        steel is to re-harden the material to
        such an extent that it will cut other
        metals, retaining its desired shape
        size and cutting edge, while at the
        same time it must not possess too
        much brittleness. The treatment
        varies materially with different brands
        of steels.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        For the average grade of the best
        High Speed Steel containing from 16%
        to 18% tungsten, the tool should be
        brought very slowly up to a dull cherry
        red. It is usually considered good
        practice to first place the tool near
        or on top of the pre-heating furnace
        before actually placing it in the pre-heater,
        in order that the heating might
        be effected just as slowly as possible.
        The pre-heating operation should
        bring the tool up to about 1600 to 1800
        degrees Fahrenheit, after which the
        tool should be placed in the high heating
        furnace and brought up to 2300
        to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit, or a white
        sweating heat. Care should be taken
        not to allow the tool to remain in this
        condition for more than an instant, as
        it is then in a very critical condition
        and could be easily burned or ruined.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        Therefore, the tool should be immediately
        pulled from the furnace and
        plunged into a good clean oil bath,
        keeping it constantly in motion.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        As High Speed Steels are air-hardening
        steels, it is also the practice to
        harden these steels by simply placing
        the cutting edge in an air blast, which
        produces maximum hardness in the desired
        point and allows the body of the
        tool to cool at a little slower rate, thus
        slightly relieving the cooling strains
        and producing a little less brittleness
        therein. Such cooling strains can be
        relieved throughout the whole tool by
        drawing the same back to about 400
        to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, and sometimes
        as high as 1050 degrees Fahrenheit,
        depending upon the particular tool
        and its use.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        The treatment of Carbon Steels
        varies with each particular brand.
        Great care must always be taken to
        heat the steel uniformly, as a material
        which is heated unevenly will expand
        and contract unevenly and, in consequence,
        will crack when quenched.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "ein">
        The steel should always be hardened
        on the rising heat, in general
        bringing the same slowly up to a dull
        cherry red, or to about 1450 degrees
        Fahrenheit, and then quenching in
        clear cold water, keeping the same in
        motion until the steel is cold. The
        temper should then be drawn according
        to the purpose of the tool, which
        could only be discussed for each particular
        case. The following range of

        <p class = "ein">
        One of the first statements which we
        could make would be that every metal
        worker in the world absolutely requires
        some form of tool steel or special alloy
        steel in the manufacture of his product.
        Of course, a very great many manufacturers
        other than the actual metal workers
        also need this same supply of tool steel
        in order that their production might not
        immediately cease. Volumes could be
        written on the vital importance of tools to
        industry in general, from the drills which
        drill out the hole in a hypodermic needle,
        to a twelve-ton drop-forge steam hammer.
        But for the present we may confine ourselves
        to simply the briefest mention of
        the vast number of iron and steel products
        actually and vitally engaged in the prosecution
        of the war.

        operations of the world which

        of that foundation, which threaten the
        stability of the entire mass. It is, therefore,
        some of these fundamental details
        which have been neglected as we have
        beheld the vision of the super-structure
        above. Pershing needs, 1,500,000 boys
        in khaki and over the shoulder of each is
        his protection against the Hun. Everyone
        of these rifles is a splendid monument
        of the accomplishment of tool steel and
        special alloy steel.

        Every day of our present existence it
        happens that over a million shells scream
        over the miles of battle line in France.
        This curtain of high explosive and shrapnel
        is another direct expression of the
        wonders which the modern high speed
        and special alloy steel have accomplished.
        We are told that a 3" shrapnel shell contains
        seventy drilled holes or a drilling
        of 19&#xBC;" in depth. That means that
        1,600,000 feet or over three hundred miles
        of drilled holes are shot away every
        twenty-four hours on the battle fronts of
        Europe.

        Four million men must work with tools
        in order that two million men may fight
        in France. These men can not, "just be
        given a tool and told to use it." It is
        necessary that they have years of careful
        training and actual experience in order
        that they might effectively make use of
        the intricate tools and machinery which
        the mother of modern industry is striving
        to place in their hands. At present every
        tool steel mill in America is straining its
        furnaces, hammers and rolling mills to
        their maximum capacity. They are working
        days, nights and Sundays and still the
        demand is far in excess of the supply.
        Conservative estimations show that with
        all the added machinery and equipment
        which is in the process of construction at
        this time, it will still take at least two
        years and a half before the tool steel industry
        of America will come any where
        near meeting the demand for its product.

        As we gaze with belated pride upon the
        huge structure of our present Preparedness,
        does it not seem strange to think
        that the most vital pillar of its whole
        foundation should have been forgotten
        and neglected so long and which is therefore
        now caused to endure such an abnormal
        and terrific strain? We are at last
        forced to realize that tool steel is the very
        essence of our whole existence.

        Of course, the great importance of tool
        steel in this national emergency does not
        stop with the actual weapons of warfare.
        Besides the railroads, automobiles, tramways,
        elevators, bridges, buildings, shoes,
        clothing and in fact, every branch of the
        intricate mass of manufactured products
        so vital to our daily existence, nations
        are crying for bread. Victory hangs on
        our food supply. Our threshing machines,
        our reapers and our harvesting
        machinery are all working over time.
        But before the threshing machines can
        thresh wheat and before the reapers can
        reap and before the tractors and other
        farm machinery can contribute their great
        service to humanity, it is necessary that
        the American production of tool steel
        must pass its rigid inspection and yield
        forth in full measure the great service
        which it is called upon to give.
